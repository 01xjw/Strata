"""Parent-loss guard and graceful-stop channel for a server launched by the local runtime host.

The inherited pipe has exactly one writer, held by the host.  EOF therefore
means the host exited, including after SIGKILL.

POSIX: the server has its own process group so its engine subprocesses receive
the emergency stop as well.  Windows: the host passes the pipe as the server's
standard input (``--owner-fd 0``) and ends the server's whole process tree
through a kill-on-close job object if it dies; the pipe is also how the host
asks the server to drain and exit (it closes its end), because Windows has no
SIGTERM to send.  EOF is turned into a Ctrl+C in the main thread, which is the
path the server already drains and stops cleanly on.
