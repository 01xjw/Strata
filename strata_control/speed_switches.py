"""The speed features of 0.2.7 that have a switch in the app's Expert settings and in the Terminal's Advanced table.

A switch has a default (``on`` or ``off``).  In its other state it writes exactly the engine environment below into the model's run config ("env"); back in
its default it removes those entries, so a default launch carries none of them and is byte for byte what 0.2.6 started.  The names are the engine switch
contract (phaseA-tests/notes-027-plan.md).  The app does the same in apps/host/server/native-settings.mjs (SPEED_SWITCHES); tests/terminal/test_speed_switches.py
reads that file and fails when the two disagree, so the Terminal and the app cannot drift apart.

- "Faster long prompts" (Qwen KVA) is OFF by default (owner decision, 26 October): ``STRATA_KVA=1`` turns it on.  A file that holds ``STRATA_KVA=0`` (the
  off switch of an earlier 0.2.7 test build) reads as off, which is what it is now.
- "Faster answers on Radeon RX 9000 / AI PRO R9700" and "DeepSeek speed-ups" are ON by default; turning them off writes their entries.

The Terminal shows the switches as rows of its Advanced table (strata_cli/launch/params.py), only where they apply: ``strata launch --set STRATA_KVA=1``
turns "Faster long prompts" on, ``--set STRATA_KVA=off`` puts the default back (the same as removing the row).
